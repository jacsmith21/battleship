There must be a folder named "music" in the Client folder; however, the game should run without the music and FX.

Returning to the home screen after signing in or registering will cause errors in the game. The protocol does not support moving back and forth between game states. Although, returing home at the leaderboards screen is possible as the server will restart each time and run until the connection is broken with a client. Returning home at this stage in the game will reset everything and you will be able to play again.
